# Do While Loop Example

This project demonstrates the use of do-while loops in Java.

It includes:
- An example of using a do-while loop to print numbers
- A comparison with a while loop
- An example where the do-while loop runs at least once, even if the condition is false at the start

## Running the Code

To run the code, compile and execute the `DoWhileLoopExample.java` file.

```bash
javac DoWhileLoopExample.java
java DoWhileLoopExample
